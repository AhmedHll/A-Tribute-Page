                    <P>Twice slain and thrice born, Mordekaiser is a brutal
                        warlord from a foregone epoch who uses his necromantic
                        sorcery to bind souls into an eternity of servitude.
                        Few now remain who remember his earlier conquests,
                        or know the true extent of his powersâ€”but there are 
                        ome ancient souls that do, and they fear the day when
                        he may return to claim dominion over both the living and the dead.</P>

                    <P>Fueled by unbridled fury and rage, Tryndamere once carvedhis way through
                        the Freljord, openly challenging the greatest warriors of the north to
                        prepare himself for even darker days ahead. The wrathful barbarian has 
                        ong sought revenge for the annihilation of his clan, though more recently
                        he has found companionship with Ashe, the Avarosan warmother, and a home 
                        ith her people. His almost inhuman strength and fortitude is legendary, 
                        nd has delivered him and his new allies countless victories against the 
                        greatest of odds.</P>
